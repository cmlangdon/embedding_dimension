Notes

Experiment:
    dim: 2, 3, 4
    epochs = 1000
    repeats = 250
    max lvar: 1e3

Summary of results:
    For dim=2, there is nice convergence but low success rate for high lvar.
    For dim=3, curves start to rise again for large lvar and fail to do the task above lvar=200.
    For dim=4, curves look like they will converge for higher lvar (e.g. 1e4)

    How does the optimization find solutions in which the task loss is low (~0.04), the dynamics are low-dimensional but
    there is no clustering?

New test:
    Adding correlated noise to inputs. My guess is that because the noise was not correlated, it was possible
    for the optimization to find solutions in which the trajectories were highly correlated and not crossing all hyperplanes.
